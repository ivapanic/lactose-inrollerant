#### In this 2D pixel art side-scroller, the player takes on the role of a cheese wheel that found itself in the middle of a medieval village rolling away from ravenous villagers and avoiding obstacles while trying to beat the previously set high score, inspired by the Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake event.
